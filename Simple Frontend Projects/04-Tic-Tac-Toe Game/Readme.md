## 📚 What I Learned
While building this project, I improved my understanding of:
- ⚡ **React hooks** (`useState`) for managing game state  
- ⚡ **Props** to pass data/functions between components  
- ⚡ **Conditional rendering** in React (showing winner/game over messages)  
- ⚡ **Event handling** (`onClick`) for interactive gameplay  
- ⚡ **State immutability** (using spread operator to update arrays)  
- ⚡ Writing a **clean folder structure** & using `.gitignore` for GitHub
