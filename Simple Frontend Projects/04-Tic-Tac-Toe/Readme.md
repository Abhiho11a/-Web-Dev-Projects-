## 📖 What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:

-⚡How to use **React Hooks** (`useState`) to manage game state.
-⚡Implementing **conditional rendering** for UI updates (winner, game over, disabling buttons).
-⚡Creating **reusable helper functions** (e.g., checking winner, tie, empty spots).
-⚡Understanding and applying the **Minimax algorithm** in a real project.
-⚡Handling **user interactions** (undo, reset, switching between single/double player modes).
-⚡Deploying a React project to **Netlify**.

## 🧠 Minimax Algorithm

The **AI opponent** uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible game outcomes and always makes the optimal move.  
That means in Single Player mode: **you can’t beat it, only draw at best 😉**.
